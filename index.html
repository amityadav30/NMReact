<!-- What’s the difference between React and ReactDOM?
React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces and ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM. -->

<!-- As the name implies, ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM. For everything else, there’s React. 
    You use React to define and create your elements, for lifecycle hooks, etc.
    i.e. the guts of a React application.

So, in brief:

React: a javascript library, designed for building user interfaces
React-DOM: a complimentary library to React which glues React to the browser DOM -->
