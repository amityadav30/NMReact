<!-- What’s the difference between React and ReactDOM?
React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces and ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM. -->

<!-- As the name implies, ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM. For everything else, there’s React. 
    You use React to define and create your elements, for lifecycle hooks, etc.
    i.e. the guts of a React application.
So, in brief:
React: a javascript library, designed for building user interfaces
React-DOM: a complimentary library to React which glues React to the browser DOM -->

<!-- Crossorigin in script tag?
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.
A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests. -->
